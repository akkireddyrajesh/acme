					<h1 class="h1 p_left">AR MGMT</h1>
					<p class="p_left p-box">The medical A/R program offered by Gensyscare overcomes the problems that traditionally hinder collection efforts by the individual providers. 
					Gcare pursues these accounts by assigning a full team of individuals to "blitz" them.</p>
					
					<p class="p_left p-box">We utilize experienced, well-trained individuals in the medical billing process as our collectors. 
					Most of these employees have years of experience in medical billing collections and coding.</p>
					
					<p class="p_left p-box phases"><p id="phase1">Phase I - Initial evaluation of medical AR Follow up</p>
						<p class="p_left1 p-box">This phase involves identification and analysis of the claims listed on the A/R Aging Report. The team will review the provider's adjustment policy from 
						which we will identify which claims need to be adjusted off. Additional claims may be identified once the analysis of timely filing limits is conducted.</p>
					</p>
					<p class="p_left p-box phases"><p id="phase2">Phase II - Analysis and prioritizing medical AR Follow up</p>
						<p class="p_left1 p-box">Experienced medical A/R analysts initiate this phase by identifying the various issues for claims that are marked as uncollectible or 
						for claims where the carrier has not paid according to its contracted rate with providers.</p>
						<p class="p_left1 p-box">The filing/appeal limits of the major carriers will be checked and also the "claims submission address" will be checked for the claims to 
						reach the correct processing unit. The team also confirms that "clean claims" will be reimbursed as per the contracted fee schedule</p>
					</p>
					<p class="p_left p-box phases"><p id="phase2">Phase III - Collecting the maximum of medical AR Follow up</p>
						<p class="p_left1 p-box">Based on the analysis and our team's findings, the claims that are identified to be within the filing limit of the carrier 
						are re-filed after verifying all the necessary billing information is correct such as claims processing address and other medical billing rules.</p>
						<p class="p_left1 p-box">Claims that have exceeded the filing limit of the carrier as well as the claims that appear to be underpaid by the carrier are appealed with the necessary supporting documents. 
						Appeal procedures vary widely depending on the plan, carrier and state. These procedures are collected and applied on claims that are being appealed.</p>
						<p class="p_left1 p-box">We will transmit the claims electronically directly to the carriers wherever possible and for the other carriers, claims are forwarded through clearing houses and 
						aggressively followed up with the carrier for confirmation.</p>
						<p class="p_left1 p-box">After completing all the above and posting payment detail to the outstanding claims, patient bills are generated as per the client guidelines 
						and then followed up with the patients for payments.</p>

			<!-- Eligibility  Verfication -->
				<div class="services-grids" id="eg_verf">
					<h1 class="h1 p_left">Eligibility  Verfication: </h1>
					<p class="p_left1 p-box">The process of obtaining the insurance eligibility verification of a patient is necessary to insure that the patient has coverage, 
					services that are being provided are covered, denials and appeals can be minimized and payments are expedited at the appropriate rates. 
					Denied claims due to no active coverage, out of network, unauthorized patient procedures or visits can be a major loss in revenue and 
					should not be taken lightly.</p>
					
					<p class="p_left1 p-box">Insurance eligibility verification process can be accomplished via a call to the Insurance Company (payer), via websites (payer or EDI) or 
					through online software currently integrated in many medical billing systems. Through accurate Insurance Eligibility Insurance Verification, 
					revenue cycle management can be improved by reducing the number of rejected medical claims and improving the cash flow to the Facility or Providers.</p>
